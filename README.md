## Introduction  

### -About This Project
This project is our first official project at my school [42][42 Silicon Valley]. The project is to create our own implementation of the standard C library. This serves two purposes, to help us learn the inner workings of the language and to use and implement in all future C projects while attending. 

### -About Me
I'm Mike Brave and I'm a programming student at [42][42 Silicon Valley]. I'm specializing in Procedural Generation and AI (basically the creative applications of AI), but I also do a lot with mobile apps, UX Design and low level C programming. I also wrote the new swift curriculum for the school.  

### -About 42  
[42][42] is a free, non profit, project-based, peer-to-peer learning coding school. It originated in France and now has over 20 campuses all over the world. More information can be found [here][42]
