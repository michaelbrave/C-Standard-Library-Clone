To fellow students who look at this see below. 
This project passed all checks from the 42FileChecker(https://github.com/jgigault/42FileChecker) and Moulibft(https://moulibft.com/) before submitted.
It also passed all tests after submission so if you can pass both of those you can probably turn it in with some confidence.
